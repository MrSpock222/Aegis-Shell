# 🛡️ Aegis Shell

Aegis Shell is a **multi-window browser** focused on privacy, stealth, and resource efficiency. Launch new browser windows directly from the main interface—each window is protected before it ever becomes visible. Built on Chromium powered by Tauri 2.0, Aegis Shell is extremely lightweight and consumes minimal system resources.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Window Engine:**  
  Open as many browser windows as you want from the main page. Each window runs isolated and protected.

- **Screenshot & Screen Recording Protection:**  
  Every window is shielded from screenshots and screen recordings. New windows only become visible **after** protection is 100% active—no flashes, no leaks, not even a single frame is exposed. Even if a screen recording is running, the new window will never appear unprotected.

- **Stealth Main Window:**  
  The main window becomes "invisible" after about a second, keeping your session private and hidden.

- **Chromium-Based & Lightweight:**  
  Enjoy the power of Chromium with a fraction of the resource usage. Aegis Shell is designed to be fast, efficient, and unobtrusive.

- **Quick Access Panel:**  
  Launch your favorite sites instantly from the home screen.

## 🏗️ How It Works

1. **Start the main window**  
   The main interface lets you enter URLs or search queries and open new browser windows.

2. **Open new windows**  
   Each new window is created in a hidden state. It only becomes visible after screenshot/screen recording protection is fully enabled—guaranteeing zero exposure.

3. **Invisible by design**  
   The main window hides itself after a short delay, further enhancing privacy.
